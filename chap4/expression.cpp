     The left-shift operator (the << operator) inserts 0-valued bits on the right. The
     behavior of the right-shift operator (the >> operator) depends on the type of the
     left-hand operand: If that operand is unsigned, then the operator inserts 0-valued
     bits on the left; if it is a signed type, the result is implementation defined—either
     copies of the sign bit or 0-valued bits are inserted on the left

As an example of using the bitwise operators let’s assume a teacher has 30 students
in a class. Each week the class is given a pass/fail quiz. We’ll track the results of each
quiz using one bit per student to represent the pass or fail grade on a given test. We
might represent each quiz in an unsigned integral value:

We define quiz1 as an unsigned long. Thus, quiz1 will have at least 32 bits on
any machine. We explicitly initialize quiz1 to ensure that the bits start out with well-
defined values.

    When Implicit Conversions Occur
 
                The compiler automatically converts operands in the following circumstances:
                        • In most expressions, values of integral types smaller than int are first
                          promoted to an appropriate larger integral type.
                        • In conditions, nonbool expressions are converted to bool.
                        • In initializations, the initializer is converted to the type of the variable; in
                          assignments, the right-hand operand is converted to the type of the left-hand.
                        • In arithmetic and relational expressions with operands of mixed types, the types
                          are converted to a common type.
                        • As we’ll see in Chapter 6, conversions also happen during function calls.
